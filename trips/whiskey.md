# **Hillwalk Tours**: Self-Guided Hiking Tours of Scotland

Imagine a Scotland hiking tour designed to meet your needs.

A hiking tour where you tell us what you want. What day you’d like to start. When you want to finish. How far you wish to hike each day.

On a Hillwalk Tours - Scotland walking holiday, the only wishes that matter are your wishes. You are the best person to decide what you want. We are the best people to organise it for you.

Every step you take on your hiking tour, we will have been there before you. Each B&B you stay at, we will have checked already.

We’ll transfer your bags, tell you all about Scottish history and folklore and show you where to find the tastiest food and the best local whisky.

Remember, it’s your holiday. Your job is to relax and enjoy yourself. _Let us take care of the details._
