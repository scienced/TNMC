Wim Hof is known nationally and internationally for constantly breaking his records in the cold. Wim has shown what the human body is more capable of once you find the flow within your physical and mental state. 

Even though the Iceman is constantly seeking to improve his current performance, he loves the challenge to pass on his methods to others in order to give everyone the opportunity to experience the benefits of the Wim Hof Method and to do more than what they thought they were capable of. With the right training and exercises you can make your inner nature stronger.

## Winter travel in Poland
The course takes place in a peaceful place in the Giant Mountains of Poland. The course is suitable for beginners, intermediate and advanced participants within Wim Hof’s methods. Age is not an issue, the only thing that matters is that participants are genuinely interested. You will learn various techniques that have a huge influence on body and mind. Everything will flow. In between the meditation sessions there is time for a walk and contemplation in the beautiful natural surroundings.
